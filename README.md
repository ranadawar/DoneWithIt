# DoneWithIt
The app will allow users to create accounts and then they will be able to add a listing of what product they want to sell. This is a fully functional 
mobile application. I used react-native to create the front-end and attached Nodejs backend for this project.

The basic idea of the app is to SELL ANYTHING YOU DON'T NEED ANYMORE and is the tagline of my application. 


IF YOU want to run and try this project on your PC go ahead download the source code and also install expo-cli on your computer then in the terminal
window go to the project folder and run "npm i" command. This will install all the packages. Then in the terminal run the command "expo start or expo 
start -c. Now you can test the application.
